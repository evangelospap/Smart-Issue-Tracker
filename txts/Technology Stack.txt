‚ÄúSmart Issue Tracker‚Äù with automatic AI-powered summaries and fix suggestions!
Let‚Äôs map out a solid tech stack for this:

üîπ Core Requirements

Issue tracking (projects, tickets, users, workflows like Jira).

AI Summaries & Suggested Fixes (via OpenAI GPT-4/5 or Anthropic Claude).

Scalable backend (to handle multi-user projects, real-time updates).

Web frontend (intuitive UI, like Jira/Linear).

Optional integrations (GitHub, Slack, Jira import/export).

üîπ Suggested Tech Stack
1. Frontend (Web App UI)

Framework: Next.js (React-based, SEO friendly, server-side rendering, API routes).

UI Components:

TailwindCSS (fast, modern styling).

Shadcn/UI or Radix UI for accessible components.

State Management: React Query (server cache) or Redux Toolkit.

Realtime updates: WebSockets (via Supabase/Socket.IO).

2. Backend (API + Business Logic)

Language/Framework:

Node.js + NestJS (structured, enterprise-ready) , Django/FastAPI (Python if your AI logic lives close to backend) or Java/SpringBoot(large scale Enterprise)

Database: PostgreSQL (robust relational DB, good for issues/projects).

ORM: Prisma (Node.js) or SQLAlchemy (Python) or Hibernate for Spring Boot.

Auth: JWT or Clerk/Auth0 for user accounts.

3. AI Layer

LLM Provider:

OpenAI GPT-4/5 (summaries, fixes).

Claude (Anthropic) for long-context tickets.

(Optionally fallback to open-source LLMs via Hugging Face or vLLM for cost control).

Integration:

Backend calls LLM API when new issue is created or updated.

Store summaries in DB alongside original issue.

Fine-tuning / embeddings if you want context-aware fixes (e.g. based on your codebase or past tickets).

4. Realtime + Collaboration

Supabase or Firebase for notifications, presence, and real-time updates.

WebSockets (Socket.IO or built-in Next.js with serverless functions).

5. DevOps & Infra

Hosting: Vercel (for Next.js frontend) + Railway/Render/Fly.io (for backend).

Database: Supabase/Postgres on RDS/Neon.

Containerization: Docker (if self-hosted).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions.

6. Optional Integrations

GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab sync (link issues to commits/PRs).

Slack/Teams notifications with AI summaries.

Jira import (for migration).

üîπ Workflow Example

User creates issue ‚Üí stored in Postgres.

Backend triggers AI worker ‚Üí calls GPT/Claude with issue text.

AI returns:

Summary (1‚Äì2 sentences).

Possible Fix Suggestion (step-by-step or code snippet).

Save AI output ‚Üí attach to issue.

Frontend shows both original + AI-enhanced view.

‚úÖ This stack is modern, scalable, and cost-efficient. You could build an MVP in Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI API first, then grow into NestJS/Django if you need more complexity.



üîπ Why Spring Boot for the Backend?

Enterprise strength: battle-tested, great for large organizations (if you aim for Jira-level reliability).

Microservices ready: can scale into multiple services later (AI service, notification service, etc.).

Great ecosystem: built-in support for security (Spring Security), persistence (Spring Data JPA), messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ).

Integration friendly: exposes REST APIs or GraphQL that your Next.js frontend can consume.

üîπ Integrating the AI Layer

You‚Äôd structure it like this:

Issue Service (Spring Boot + Postgres)

CRUD for issues/projects/users.

Exposes REST or GraphQL endpoints.

AI Service (can be part of Spring Boot or separate microservice)

Calls OpenAI/Claude APIs via WebClient (reactive HTTP client in Spring).

Example flow:

Issue created ‚Üí Event published (via Kafka/RabbitMQ or simple async call).

AI service consumes ‚Üí sends request to GPT/Claude ‚Üí returns summary + suggested fix.

Stores AI response in DB.

Frontend (Next.js)

Calls the backend for issues.

Displays both raw description and AI-generated summary/suggestion.

üîπ Example Stack (Spring Boot Backend)

Backend Framework: Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin).

Database: PostgreSQL.

ORM: Spring Data JPA (Hibernate).

API: REST (with OpenAPI/Swagger) or GraphQL (via Spring GraphQL).

AI Calls:

OpenAI Java SDK (or just call their REST API with Spring WebClient).

Same for Claude (Anthropic).
