🚀 MVP Roadmap (0 → Demo)
Week 1 — Core Foundation

Goal: Basic issue tracker working end-to-end.

Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind):

Landing page + Login (Clerk/Auth0).

Basic dashboard (list of issues).

Form to create new issue.

Backend (Spring Boot + Postgres):

User + Project + Issue models (JPA).

REST API: POST /issues, GET /issues.

Connect to PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase/Local).

✅ By end of Week 1 → You can create and list issues manually.

Week 2 — AI Integration

Goal: Auto-summaries and suggested fixes.

Backend AI Service:

Add AiClient (calls OpenAI/Claude).

Async job (thread pool or message queue).

On POST /issues, trigger AI call.

Save ai_summary + ai_suggestion in DB.

Frontend:

Show AI summary + suggestion under each issue.

Loading state (spinner until AI response arrives).

✅ By end of Week 2 → Create an issue, see AI summary/fix suggestion appear.

Week 3 — Real-Time Updates

Goal: Issues auto-refresh when AI completes.

Backend:

Add Spring WebSocket (/topic/issue-updates).

Push message when AI summary is ready.

Frontend:

Subscribe via WebSocket (SockJS + Stomp).

UI updates instantly when AI summary arrives.

✅ By end of Week 3 → No refresh needed, AI results pop in live.

Week 4 — UX & Collaboration

Goal: Make it feel Jira-like.

Frontend:

Project board (Kanban-style using drag-and-drop).

Filters/search.

Simple comments per issue.

Backend:

Add “comments” model + API.

Push WebSocket updates for comments too.

✅ By end of Week 4 → Looks like a mini-Jira, AI-enhanced.

Week 5 — Polish & Demo

Goal: Deploy + prepare for user demo.

Deployment:

Frontend → Vercel.

Backend → Railway/Render/Fly.io (Spring Boot container).

Database → Neon/Postgres (managed).

Polish:

Better UI (shadcn/ui, icons, Kanban polish).

Basic analytics (count of issues, avg resolution time).

Error handling for AI (fallback if model fails).

✅ By end of Week 5 → A working Smart Issue Tracker demo:

Create an issue → AI auto-summarizes + suggests a fix → live updates → nice Kanban board.

⚡ Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)

Integrations: GitHub/Slack/Jira import.

Embeddings: Fine-tune suggestions using your team’s historical tickets.

Multi-tenant support: Companies with their own workspaces.

AI Agents: Let AI auto-assign issues or draft PRs.
